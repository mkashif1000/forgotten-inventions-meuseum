                        <h3>What qualifies as a "forgotten invention"?</h3>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We consider any technology or invention that was developed but failed to achieve widespread adoption or was later rendered obsolete. This includes technologies that were ahead of their time, lost format wars, faced insurmountable technical challenges, or were simply outcompeted by alternatives.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Currently, we exist solely as a virtual museum. However, we occasionally partner with physical museums and technology exhibitions to showcase forgotten inventions in temporary exhibits. We hope to establish a permanent physical location in the future.</p>

                        <p>Our team of technology historians and researchers reviews all submissions for historical accuracy. We rely on primary sources, patent records, contemporary accounts, and academic research to verify information. If we cannot confirm certain details, we clearly note this in the exhibition.</p>

                        <p>While we don't currently maintain a physical collection, we are interested in photographing and documenting physical artifacts.

                        <h3>Why study failed or forgotten technologies?</h3>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Failed technologies provide valuable insights into innovation processes, market dynamics, and technological evolution. Many abandoned ideas contain brilliant solutions that were simply ahead of their time or faced practical limitations that no longer exist. By studying technological "dead ends," we can learn lessons applicable to current and future innovation.</p>
